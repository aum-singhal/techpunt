    <p>There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
 
        Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths. 
        A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and the following is the general form of a loop statement in most programming languages.
    </p>

    <p>C programming language provides the following types of loops to handle looping requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>while loop in C
    </h2>

    <p>A while loop statement in the C programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true.
 
        Syntax
        The syntax of a while loop in C programming language is:
    </p>
    
    <p id="code">
        while(condition)
        {
        statement(s);
        }

    </p>

    <p>
        Here, statement(s) may be a   single statement or block of statements.  The condition may be any expression, and true is any nonzero value. The loop iterates while the condition is true.
 
        When the condition becomes false, program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

    </p>

    <img src="/assets/data/while loop.png" alt="while loops flow diagram- a given statemt will be executed till the condition specified is remains true">

    <p>Here, key point of the while loop is that the loop might not ever run. When the condition is tested and the result is false, the loop body will be skipped and the first statement after the while loop will be executed.
 
        Example
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 10;
            
        /* while loop execution */ while( a < 20 )
        {
        printf("value of a: %d\n", a); a++;
        }
        return 0;
        }
        
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        value of a: 10 
        value of a: 11 
        value of a: 12 
        value of a: 13 
        value of a: 14 
        value of a: 15 
        value of a: 16 
        value of a: 17 
        value of a: 18
        value of a: 19

    </p>
    <h2>for loop in C</h2>

    <p>A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows you to efficiently write a loop that needs to execute a specific number of times.
        Syntax
        The syntax of a for loop in C programming language is:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        for ( init; condition; increment )
        {
        statement(s);
        }

    </p>

    <p>
        Here is the flow of control in a for loop:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The init step is executed first, and only once. This step allows you to declare and initialize any loop control variables. You are not required to put a statement here, as long as a semicolon appears.</li>
        <li>Next, the condition is evaluated. If it is true, the body of the loop is executed. If it is false, the body of the loop does not execute and the flow of control jumps to the next statement just after the for a loop.</li>
        <li>After the body of the for loop executes, the flow of  control jumps back up to the increment statement. This statement allows you to update any loop control variables. This statement can be left blank, as long as a semicolon appears after the condition.</li>
        <li>The condition is now evaluated again. If it is true, the loop executes and the process repeats itself (body of the loop, then increment step, and then again condition). After the condition becomes false, the for loop terminates.
        </li>

    </ol>

    <p>Flow Diagram</p>

    <img src="/assets/data/for loop.png" alt="for loop flow diagram- the statement will be executed while the given condition is true">

    <p>Example</p>
    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* for loop execution */
        for( int a = 10; a < 20; a = a + 1 )
        {
        printf("value of a: %d\n", a);
        }
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        value of a: 10 
        value of a: 11 
        value of a: 12 
        value of a: 13 
        value of a: 14 
        value of a: 15 
        value of a: 16 
        value of a: 17 
        value of a: 18
        value of a: 19

    </p>

    <h2>do...while loop in C    </h2>

    <p>Unlike for and while loops,   which test the loop  condition at the top of the loop, the do...while loop in C programming language checks its condition at the bottom of the loop.
 
        A do...while loop is similar to a while loop, except that a do...while loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time.
         
        Syntax
        The syntax of a do...while loop in C programming language is:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        do
        {
        statement(s);
        }while( condition );

    </p>

    <p>
        Notice that the conditional expression appears at the end of the loop, so the statement(s) in the loop executes once before the condition is tested.

        If the condition is true, the flow of control jumps back up to do, and the statement(s) in the loop execute again. This process repeats until the given condition becomes false.

    </p>

    <img src="/assets/data/do while loop.png" alt="do while loop flow diagram- here first the given statement will be execute and then the condition will be checked">    

    <p>Example</p>

        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 10;
        /* do loop execution */ do
        {
        printf("value of a: %d\n", a); a = a + 1;
        }while( a < 20 );
        return 0;
        }
        
    </p>

        value of a: 19

    </p>

    <h2>nested loops in C
    </h2>

    <p>C programming language allows using one loop inside another loop. The following section shows few examples to illustrate the concept.
 
        Syntax
        The syntax for a nested for loop statement in C is as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        for ( init; condition; increment )
        {
        for ( init; condition; increment )
        {
        statement(s);
        }
        statement(s);
        }

    </p>

    <p>The syntax for a nested while loop statement in the C programming language is as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        while(condition)
        {
        while(condition)
        {
        statement(s);
        }
        statement(s);
        }

    </p>

    <p>The syntax for a nested do...while loop statement in C programming language is as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        do
        {
        statement(s); do
        {
        statement(s);
        }while( condition );
        }while( condition );

    </p>

    <p>A final note on loop nesting is that you can put any type of loop inside of any other type of loop. For example, a for loop can be inside a while loop or vice versa.
 
        Example
        The following program uses a nested for loop to find the prime numbers from 2 to 100:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int i, j;
        for(i=2; i<100; i++) { for(j=2; j <= (i/j); j++)
        if(!(i%j)) break; // if factor found, not prime if(j > (i/j)) printf("%d is prime\n", i);
        } 
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        2  is prime
        3  is prime
        5 is prime
        7 is prime
        11 is prime
        13 is prime
        17 is prime
        19 is prime
        23 is prime
        29 is prime
        31 is prime
        37 is prime
        41 is prime
        43 is prime
        47 is prime
        53 is prime
        59 is prime
        61 is prime
        67 is prime
        71 is prime
        73 is prime
        79 is prime
        83 is prime
        89 is prime
        97 is prime

    </p>

    <h2>Break statement in C</h2>
    <p>The break statement in the C programming language has the following two usages:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
        </li>
        <li> It can be used to terminate a case in the switch statement (covered in the next chapter).
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If you are using nested loops (i.e., one loop inside another loop), the break statement will stop the execution of the innermost loop and start executing the next line of code after the block.
 
        Syntax
        The syntax for a break statement in C is as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        break;
    </p>

    <p>Flow Diagram</p>
    <img src="/assets/data/break.png" alt="break statement flow diagram- this forces a statement to stop abruptly at any given point">
    <p>Example</p>

    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 10;
        
        /* while loop execution */ while( a < 20 )
        {
        printf("value of a: %d\n", a); a++;
        if( a > 15)
        {
        /* terminate the loop using break statement */ break;
        }
        }
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        value of a: 10 
        value of a: 11 
        value of a: 12 
        value of a: 13 
        value of a: 14
        value of a: 15

    </p>

    <h2>Continue statement in C</h2>
    <p>
        The continue statement in the C   programming   language works somewhat like the break statement. Instead of forcing termination, however, continue forces the next iteration of the loop to take place, skipping any code in between.
 
        For the for loop, the continue statement causes the conditional test and increment portions of the loop to execute. For the while and do...while loops, continue statement causes the program control to pass to the conditional tests.
         
        Syntax
        The syntax for a continue statement in C is as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">continue;</p>
    <p>Flow Diagram</p>

    <img src="/assets/data/continue.png" alt="continue flow diagram">

    <p>Example</p>
    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 10;
        /* do loop execution */ do
        {
        if( a == 15)
        {
        /* skip the iteration */ a = a + 1;
        continue;
        }
        printf("value of a: %d\n", a); a++;
        }while( a < 20 ); return 0;
        }
        

    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        value of a: 10
        value of a: 11
        value of a: 12 
        value of a: 13 
        value of a: 14 
        value of a: 16 
        value of a: 17 
        value of a: 18
        value of a: 19

    </p>

    <h2>goto statement in C
    </h2>

    <p>A goto statement in C programming language provides an unconditional jump from the
        goto to a labeled statement in the same function.
         
        NOTE: Use of goto statement is highly discouraged in any programming language because it makes difficult to trace the control flow of a program, making the program hard to understand and hard to modify. Any program that uses a goto can be rewritten so that it doesn't need the goto.
         
        Syntax
        The syntax for a goto statement in C is as follows:
        
    </p>
    
    <p id="code">
        goto label;
        ..
        .
        label: statement;

    </p>

    <p>Here label can be any plain text except the C keyword and it can be set anywhere in the C program above or below to goto statement.
        Flow Diagram
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/data/goto .png" alt="goto flow diagram- it instructs the program to go to a specific statement">

    <p>Example</p>
    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 10;
            
        /* do loop execution */ LOOP:do
        {
        if( a == 15)
        {
        /* skip the iteration */ a = a + 1;
        goto LOOP;
        }
        printf("value of a: %d\n", a); a++;
        }while( a < 20 ); return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

    </p>

    <p id="code">
        value of a: 10 
        value of a: 11 
        value of a: 12 
        value of a: 13
        value of a: 14 
        value of a: 16 
        value of a: 17 
        value of a: 18
        value of a: 19

    </p>

    <h2>The Infinite Loop</h2>
    <p>A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The for loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the for loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.</p>

    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        for( ; ; )
        {
        printf("This loop will run forever.\n");
        }
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the conditional expression is absent, it is assumed to be true. You may have an initialization and increment expression, but C programmers more commonly use the for(;;) construct to signify an infinite loop.
 
        NOTE: You can terminate an infinite loop by pressing Ctrl + C keys.
    </p>
