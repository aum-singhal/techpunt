    <h1>C Program Structure    </h1>
    <p>Tradition dictates that we start with a really simple program, which simply displays the characters “Hello, World!” on the screen and immediately exits.
        Let us check out an easy code that might print the words "Hello World":
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        #include int main()
        {
        /* my first program in C */
            printf("Hello, World! \n");
            return 0;
        }

    </p>

    <p>Let us check out various parts of the above program:    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The primary line of the program #include may be a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to incorporate stdio.h file before getting to actual compilation.</li>
        <li>subsequent line int main() is that the main function where program execution begins.</li>
        <li>The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program. So such lines are called comments within the program.</li>
        <li>subsequent line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.</li>
        <li>The next line return 0; terminates main()function and returns the value 0. </li>
    </ol>
