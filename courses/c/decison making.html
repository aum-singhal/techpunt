    <h1>Decision Making in C
    </h1>

    <p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, alongside a press release or statements to be executed if the condition is decided to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is decided to be false.
        Following is that the general sort of a typical decision-making structure found in most of the programming languages:
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/data/if.png" alt="if decision-making structure- condition if true code is executed if false code is skipped">

    <p>C programing language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true, and if it's either zero or null, then it's assumed as a false value. C programing language provides the subsequent sorts of decision-making statements.
    </p>

    <h2>if statement</h2>
    <p>An if statement consists of a boolean expression followed by one or more statements.
 
        Syntax
        The syntax of an if statement in the C programming language is: 
    </p>

    <p id="code">
    if(boolean_expression)
    {
    /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true */
    }

    </p>

    <p>
    If the boolean expression evaluates to true, then the block of code inside the if statement are going to be executed. If the boolean expression evaluates to false, then the primary set of code after the top of the if statement (after the closing curly brace) are going to be executed.
 
    C programing language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true and if it's either zero or null then it's assumed as a false value.

    </p>

    <img src="/assets/data/if.png" alt="if decision-making structure- condition if true code is executed if false code is skipped">

    <p>Example</p>
    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 10
        /* check the boolean condition using if statement */ if( a < 20 )
        {
        /* if condition is true then print the following */ printf("a is less than 20\n" );
        }
        printf("value of a is : %d\n", a);
        
        return 0;
        }
           
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">a is less than 20;
        value of a is : 10
    </p>

    <h2>if...else statement    </h2>

    <p>An if statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the boolean expression is false.
 
    Syntax
    The syntax of an if...else statement in the C programming language is:
    </p>

    <p id="code">if(boolean_expression)
        {
        /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is true */
        }
        else
        {
        /* statement(s) will execute if the boolean expression is false */
        }
    </p>

    <p> If the boolean expression evaluates to true, then if a block of code will be executed, otherwise else block of code will be executed.
        C programming language assumes any non-zero and non-null values as true and if it is either zero or null then it is assumed as a false value
    </p>

    <img src="/assets/data/if-else.png" alt="if-else flow diagram- if condition is true then if part will be executed if not then else part will be executed">

    <p>Example</p>
    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 100;
        /* check the boolean condition */ if( a < 20 )
        {
        /* if condition is true then print the following */ printf("a is less than 20\n" );
        }
        else
        {
        /* if condition is false then print the following */ printf("a is not less than 20\n" );
        }
        printf("value of a is : %d\n", a);
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
    
    <p id="code">a is not less than 20;
        value of a is : 100
    </p>

    <h2>The if...else if...else Statement</h2>

    <p>An if statement can be followed by an optional else if...else statement, which is very useful to test various conditions using single if...else if statement.
 
        When using if , else if , else statements there are few points to keep in mind:
         
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>An if can have zero or one else's and it must come after any else if's.
        </li>
        <li>An if can have zero to many else if's and they must come before the else.
        </li>
        <li>Once an else if succeeds, none of the remaining else if's or else's will be tested.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Syntax
        The syntax of an if...else if...else statement in C programming language is:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        if(boolean_expression 1)
        {
        /* Executes when the boolean expression 1 is true */
        }
        else if( boolean_expression 2)
        {
        /* Executes when the boolean expression 2 is true */
        }
        else if( boolean_expression 3)
        {
        /* Executes when the boolean expression 3 is true */
        }
        else
        {
        /* executes when the none of the above condition is true */
        }

    </p>

    <p>Example</p>
    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
 
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 100;
            
        /* check the boolean condition */ if( a == 10 )
        {
        /* if condition is true then print the following */ printf("Value of a is 10\n" );
        }
        else if( a == 20 )
        {
        /* if else if condition is true */ printf("Value of a is 20\n" );
        }
        else if( a == 30 )
        {
        /* if else if condition is true  */ printf("Value of a is 30\n" );
        }
        else
        {
        /* if none of the conditions is true */ printf("None of the values is matching\n" );
        }
        printf("Exact value of a is: %d\n", a );
            
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">None of the values is matching
        Exact value of a is: 100
    </p>

    <h2>Nested if statements
    </h2>

    <p>It is always legal in C programming to nest if-else statements, which means you can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement(s).
 
        Syntax
        The syntax for a nested if statement is as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        if( boolean_expression 1)
        {
        /* Executes when the boolean expression 1 is true */ if(boolean_expression 2)
        {
        /* Executes when the boolean expression 2 is true */
        }
        }

    </p>

    <p>You can nest else if...else in the similar way as you have nested if statement.

        Example
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
 
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 100;
        int b = 200;
            
        /* check the boolean condition */
        if( a == 100 )
        {
        /* if condition is true then check the following */ if( b == 200 )
        {
        /* if condition is true then print the following */ printf("Value of a is 100 and b is 200\n" );
        }
        }
        printf("Exact value of a is : %d\n", a ); printf("Exact value of b is : %d\n", b );
            
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>
        When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:

    </p>

    <p id="code">
        Value of a is 100 and b is 200 Exact value of a is : 100
        Exact value of b is : 200

    </p>

    <h2>Switch statement</h2>

    <p>
        A switch statement allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values. Each value is called a case, and the variable being switched on is checked for each switch case.
 
        Syntax
        The syntax for a switch statement in C programming language is as follows:

    </p>

    <p id="code">
        switch(expression){
        case constant-expression  : statement(s);
        break; /* optional */ case constant-expression                       	:
        statement(s);
        break; /* optional */
            
        /* you can have any number of case statements */ default : /* Optional */
        statement(s);
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>
        The following rules apply to a switch statement:
 
        The expression used in a switch statement must have an integral or enumerated type, or be of a class type in which the class has a single conversion function to an integral or enumerated type.

        You can have any number of case statements within a switch. Each case is followed by the value to be compared to and a colon.

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>The constant-expression for a case must be the same data type as the variable in the switch, and it must be a constant or a literal.</li>
        <li>When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.</li>
        <li>When a break statement is reached, the switch terminates, and the flow of control jumps to the next line following the switch statement.</li>
        <li>Not every case needs to contain a break. If no break appears, the flow of control will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.</li>
        <li>A switch statement can have an optional default case, which must appear at the end of the switch. The default case can be used for performing a task when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.  </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Flow diagram</p>

    <img src="/assets/data/switch.png" alt="switch statement flow diagram- an expression will be checked for each case and will run if any of them is true if not then the default statement will be executed (if present)">

    <p>Example</p>
    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
 
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ char grade = 'B';
        switch(grade)
        {
        case 'A' :
        printf("Excellent!\n" ); break;
        case 'B' :
        case 'C' :
        printf("Well done\n" ); break;
        case 'D' :
        printf("You passed\n" ); break;
        case 'F' :
        printf("Better try again\n" ); break;
        default :
        printf("Invalid grade\n" );
        }
        printf("Your grade is  %c\n", grade );
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        Well done 
        Your grade is B
    </p>

    <h2>Nested switch statements
    </h2>

    <p>It is possible to have a switch as part of the statement sequence of an outer switch. Even if the case constants of the inner and outer switch contain common values, no conflicts will arise.
 
        Syntax
        The syntax for a nested switch statement is as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        switch(ch1) { case 'A':
        printf("This A is part of outer switch" ); switch(ch2) {
        case 'A':
        printf("This A is part of inner switch" ); break;
        case 'B': /* case code */
        }
        break;
        case 'B': /* case code */
        }

    </p>

    <p>Example</p>

    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
        int main ()
        {
        /* local variable definition */ int a = 100;
        int b = 200;
            
        switch(a) { case 100:
        printf("This is part of outer switch\n", a ); switch(b) {
        case 200:
        printf("This is part of inner switch\n", a );
        }
        }
        printf("Exact value of a is : %d\n", a ); printf("Exact value of b is : %d\n", b );
            
        return 0;
        }
            
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        This is part of outer switch This is part of inner switch Exact value of a is : 100
        Exact value of b is : 200

    </p>

    <h2>The ? : Operator
    </h2>

    <p>We have covered conditional operator ? : in previous chapter which can be  used  to replace if...else statements. It has the following general form:
    </p>

    <p id="code">
        Exp1 ? Exp2 : Exp3;
    </p>

    <p>
        Where Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3 are expressions. Notice the use and placement of the colon.
 
        The value of a ? expression is determined like this: Exp1 is evaluated. If it is true, then Exp2 is evaluated and becomes the value of the entire ? expression. If Exp1 is false, then Exp3 is evaluated and its value becomes the value of the expression.
