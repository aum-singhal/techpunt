    <h1>TypeDef</h1>
    <p>The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define the term BYTE for one-byte numbers:    </p>
    
    <p id="code">typedef unsigned char BYTE;</p>

    <p>After this type definitions, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the type unsigned char, for example:
    </p>

    <p id="code">BYTE  b1, b2;</p>

    <p>By convention, uppercase letters are used for these definitions to remind the user that the type name is really a symbolic abbreviation, but you can use lowercase, as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">typedef unsigned char byte;</p>
    <p>
        You can use typedef to give a name to user-defined data type as well. For example, you can use typedef with the structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define structure variables directly as follows:
    </p>

    <p id="code">#include <stdio.h> #include <string.h>
 
        typedef struct Books
        {
        char  title[50]; char  author[50]; char  subject[100]; int   book_id;
        } Book;
         
        int main( )
        {
        Book book;
         
        strcpy( book.title, "C Programming"); 
        strcpy( book.author, "Nuha Ali");
        strcpy( book.subject, "C Programming Tutorial");
        
        
        
        book.book_id = 6495407;
         
        printf( "Book title : %s\n", book.title); 
        printf( "Book author : %s\n", book.author); 
        printf( "Book subject : %s\n", book.subject); 
        printf( "Book book_id : %d\n", book.book_id);
         
        return 0;
        }
        
    </p>
    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>

    <p id="code">
        Book  title : C Programming Book  author : Nuha Ali
        Book  subject : C Programming Tutorial
        Book  book_id : 6495407

    </p>

    <h2>typedef vs #define</h2>

    <p>The #define is a C-directive which is also used to define the aliases for various data types similar to typedef but with three differences:    </p>

    <ol>    
        <li>The typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only where as #define can be used to define alias for values as well, like you can define 1 as ONE etc.</li>
        <li>The typedef interpretation is performed by the compiler where as #define statements are processed by the pre-processor.    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Following is a simplest usage of #define:</p>

    <p id="code">
        #include <stdio.h>
 
        #define TRUE  1
        #define FALSE 0
            
        int main( )
        {
        printf( "Value of TRUE : %d\n", TRUE); printf( "Value of FALSE : %d\n", FALSE);
            
        return 0;
        }
        
    </p>

    <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:    </p>

    <p id="code">
        Value of TRUE : 1
        Value of FALSE : 0

    </p>
